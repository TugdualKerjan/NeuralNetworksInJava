# NeuralNetworksInJava
NeuralNetworks from scratch in java

![](nn_demo.gif)

My fascination with neural networks came from watching Sethbling - shortly after I gave my first attempt at writing neural networks in Java, and then basically copy pasted this code when arriving in Uni as the first programming task was KNNs, and I wanted a good grade so showing off my MNIST network seemed correct. I got a 6/6 with a mention stating that my code was crap but the POC with the NN made up for it ;)

It also contains a demo for an Encoder Decoder architecture, something I didn't know I would be using much more now with VAE's becoming trendy but back then it was a simple proof that networks could learn to compress data through bottlenecks.

### How to run it:

```bash
cd NeuralNetworkBasic
java -cp bin baguette.NeuralNetwork
